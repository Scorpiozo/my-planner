**PLANNER CORE** is a high-performance productivity HUD (Heads-Up Display). It eliminates the friction of traditional task management by providing an immersive, glassmorphic environment where objectives are managed with zero latency and high visual precision.

### 🛡️ Core Engine (Vanilla JS)
The system operates on a zero-dependency architecture.
* **State Synchronization:** Real-time progress tracking via a dynamic efficiency meter.
* **Watchdog Protocol:** An automated monitoring loop that flags overdue objectives and triggers visual "shake" alerts on the notification bell.
* **Native OS Integration:** Leverages the Browser Notification API to deliver mission-critical pings directly to the desktop.

### 🎨 HUD Customization
The system is built for personalization via a modular theme engine.
* **Global Variable Injection:** Change one hex code to re-skin the entire application, from icon glows to ambient background orbs.
* **Glassmorphism UI:** Precision 1px borders with `rgba` light-leak effects for a premium hardware feel.

### 💾 Local-First Persistence
* **Zero-Latency Data:** No database round-trips. Objectives are stored in the client-side `LocalStorage` for instant access and total user privacy.

## 💎 Design Philosophy:
PLANNER CORE is built on three pillars of interface engineering:
1. **Visual Depth:** Utilizing hardware-accelerated `backdrop-filter` layers to create a multi-layered workspace.
2. **Atmospheric Feedback:** A dual-tone background engine that provides a non-intrusive ambient glow, syncing with the system theme.
3. **Tactile Response:** Every interaction—from a task completion to a theme shift—is met with subtle CSS transitions to reinforce system feedback.

## 📜 Professional Standard
> "The interface is the environment. The environment dictates the output."

**PLANNER CORE** represents a shift from "software as a tool" to "software as a workspace." Designed with intent, coded with precision.
